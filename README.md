# Release Support - Tjibbe

Support tooling that tries to solve the issue of properly tagging your code.

## Inspired

This application is inspired by the Makefile originally developed by Mark van Holsteijn. We wanted the application to be able to work without configuration files so there are some small changes.

## Libraries used

- https://github.com/spf13/cobra
- https://github.com/spf13/viper
- https://github.com/jepma/go-versioning
- https://github.com/jepma/go-git
- https://github.com/jepma/go-vipersaveconfig

## How does it work

## Wishlist

### 1. Custom version format

As a user I would like to determine the format of the version string that is used in the tag. By default this value can be configured as `v0.0.1` for example but I would also would like to use pre-configured settings like:

- no. of commits
- last commit hash
